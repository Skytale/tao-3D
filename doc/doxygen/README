Doxygen used by Tao:
Tao uses doxygen to generate its documentation. As XL is not recognized by doxygen,
pseudo C files are generated and then read by Doxygen. But XL documentation don't
want parenthesis surrounding parameters. So the memberdef.cpp file of doxygen is
modify to force to FALSE the parenthesis parameter of some functions.

In this directory you will find
 * original doxygen sources in tar.gz format 
 * the modified memberdef.cpp (Modified lines are tagged by // TAODYNE )
 * the compiled doxygen for MacOS X

If building doxygen is required :
tar xfz doxygen-1.7.3.src.tar.gz
cp memberdef.cpp  doxygen-1.7.3/src
cd doxygen-1.7.3
sh ./configure
make
