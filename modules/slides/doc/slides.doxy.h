 * @defgroup Slides Themes for slides
 * @ingroup Modules
 *
 * Commands and themes to write a slide deck.
 *
 * The Slides module defines commands that you can use to define the structure
 * of your presentations: @ref slide, @ref title_slide, @ref base_slide,
 * @ref title_only_slide and more. You can write text bullets with symbols
 * like @ref ＊, @ref ‐ and  @ref ＋. \n
 *
 * The slide layout and colors are grouped by themes. Each theme as a name,
 * for instance @c "Keyboard" or @c "WhiteOnGray". Selecting a theme is just the
 * matter of setting the variable @ref theme to the suitable value, before using
 * the slide commands. For example:
 @code
 // Show a title slide with the default theme (black on white)
 title_slide "My title slide",
     text "This shows the default theme"
 // Change theme to "Keyboard"
 theme := "Keyboard"
 slide "The Keyboard theme",
 *     * "Has a background picture"
 *     * "Is nicer than the default theme"
 @endcode
 *
 * The Slides module currently defines five themes in addition to the default
 * one, which is black text on white backround and can be selected by setting
 * @ref theme to any value that is not a valid theme name (for instance,
 * theme := "Default" or, more simply, theme := ""). See @ref theme for
 * details.
 *
 * In addition to these themes, the module exposes an interface so that
 * you can customize the appearance of your slides (font family, size and
 * weight; bullets; text backround; colors...)
 * @todo Document this interface.
 *
 * Here is a more complete example showing all the slide types for some
 * themes in this module.
 * @include slides.ddd
 *
 * Here is a mosaic of all the pages generated by the above program,
 * <a href="examples/slides.ddd">slides.ddd</a>:

/**
 * The name of the current theme.
 * The next command that creates a slide page will take into account the
 * value of this variable to select the appearance of the slide.
 * The possible values are:
 *  @li "WhiteOnBlack" The default theme  with black and white reversed
 *  @li "WhiteOnGray" Similar to the default theme, with white text on a gray
 *      backround
 *  @li "Rounded" Similar to the default, with the addition of a thin black
 *      rounded rectangle around text areas
 *  @li "Keyboard" A slightly more sophisticated theme, with a background
 *      picture and semi-transparent white text boxes
 *  @li "Seyes" A theme that uses a handwriting font on a backround that looks
 *      like french ruled ("seyes") paper
