Tao module SDK - Instructions to build the example modules
----------------------------------------------------------


I) Building and installing modules
   ===============================

 0. Prerequisites

 - Qt 4 (4.7.4 or later).
 - Tao Presentations
 - [Windows only] MinGW

 1. Build and install a local copy of the modules

$ cd tao_sdk/modules
$ ./configure
$ make install

This will copy the modules under your "Application Support" directory:
 - MacOSX:
            "~/Library/Application Support/Tao Presentations/modules"
 - Windows:
            "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tao Presentations\modules"
 - Linux:
            "~/.local/share/data/Taodyne/Tao Presentations/modules"

Start Tao Presentations: the new modules will be detected automatically.


II) Uninstalling a module
    =====================

To uninstall a module, simply delete its installation directory.


III) Testing the modules
     ===================

Create a new .ddd document and import the module you want to test, for example:

// test.ddd
import HelloWorld
writeln hello_world


IV) Adding a new module
    ===================

To add a new module:

 1. Make a copy of an example as a starting point. In order of increasing
   complexity:
    - hello_world is the simplest module possible. It has no native code; only
      XL language in hello_world.xl.
    - lorem_ipsum has some simple native code (new primitives), but no
      graphics.
    - object_loader defines new primitives, uses a 3rd party library and makes
      OpenGL calls.
 2. Rename the directory and the project file (.pro). They must have the same
    name or qmake will complain (if directory is "foo" then project file must
    be "foo.pro").
 3. Edit the file <module_name>.xl:
    - Change the module identifier (id=). Use a Univerally Unique Identifier
      (UUID) to make sure your module won't conflict with any other Tao module.
      You may use the uuidgen command.
    - Change the name, description, import_name, etc.
 4. Rename and adapt C++ source files and the .tbl file (if any). Update the
    .pro accordingly. You can provide your own icon for the module, too.
 5. Run ./configure && make install


V) Troubleshooting
   ===============

You can check which modules are detected by selecting the Preferences menu
(Tao Presentations>Preferences on MacOSX, Help>Preferences on Windows). In this
dialog box you can also disable or enable modules.

Modules from the user's home directory are loaded first, followed by
modules in the application directory. Therefore, if two modules with the same
identifier are found under both locations, the user's one is preferred and
the other one is ignored.

Module debugging can be turned on as follows:
  - Select the Debug group in the Preferences dialog, click the "modules"
    checkbox, click "Save". Restart Tao.
  - Or, through the command line option: -tmodules

When Tao is started from a command window, the debug traces are sent to the
standard error output (stderr). Otherwise, the destination of the traces
depend on the platform:
  - On Windows, traces are written to %HOMEPATH%\Documents\Tao\tao.log,
  - On MacOSX, they are visible with the console application.
