Here are the steps to create a new (official) release of Tao Presentations

Once:

- Make sure Qt translations are up-to-date
  $ cd tao
  $ make lupdate
  Look at the output of lupdate, and edit tao_fr.ts as needed.
  After editing tao_fr.ts:
  $ make lrelease
  Commit your translations (both tao_fr.ts AND tao_fr.qm need to be committed).
- Make sure tao.xl translations are up-to-date
  $ ./extract_tr.pl -ref tao_fr.xl tao.xl
  If the command returns nothing, there is nothing to do, otherwise append
  translations to tao_fr.xl, and commit.
- There is no easy way to make sure other translations (e.g., module/template
  descriptions) are up-to-date :(

On all platforms:

- Create a temporary tag, for instance:
  $ git tag 1.0-beta5 
- Clean work directory
  $ make distclean
- Build and make kits
  $ ./configure
  $ make -j5 install
  $ make kit
 
Once:

- Create an annotated tag with the MD5 hash of all kits.
  Take inspiration from 'git show 1.0-beta4' for instance. 
  $ git tag -a 1.0-beta5 

- Upload files to the Taodyne web site, do not forget to update
  the release name (beta9) in:
    www/application/frontend/language/english/beta_lang.php
    www/application/frontend/language/french/beta_lang.php
