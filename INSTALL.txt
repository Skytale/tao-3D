            How to build Tao Presentations
            ==============================

*** Windows 7, Windows Vista ***

Tao Presentations for Windows is built in the MinGW environment with the GCC
compiler. You need to have a number of software packages installed before you
can build Tao: the Qt SDK, MSYSGit, LLVM, and optionally doxygen and NSIS.
Here is a step-by-tep guide.

- Install the latest Qt SDK from http://qt.nokia.com.
  Select the "LGPL" download and install it. Keep the default options.
  Remember the installation directory, you will have to add it to your PATH.
  For instance for Qt 4.7.2, the default path is C:\Qt\2010.05.

- Install msysgit from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
  You should pick the "full installer" version to get a version of make,
  which will prove useful for building LLVM (LLVM wants gmake to build).
  At the end of the installation, create a shortcut on the desktop with the
  command:
  $ /share/msysGit/add-shortcut.tcl Desktop

- Optional: install doxygen (to compile the Tao documentation).
  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html
  Then make sure the "doxygen" command is in your Windows PATH.
  
- Start the msysgit bash shell (use the desktop shortcut).
  cd $HOME. Create the file $HOME/.profile with the following line:

  export PATH=/c/llvm/bin:/c/Qt/2010.05/mingw/bin:/c/Qt/2010.05/qt/bin:$PATH

  Note:
  * /c/llvm/bin is where you will install LLVM (see below). LLVM is required
    to build Tao Presentations.
  * /c/Qt/2010.05/mingw/bin is the location of the GCC compiler we will use
  * /c/Qt/2010.05/qt/bin is for Tao Presentations to find the Qt DLLs

- Download LLVM 2.9rc1:
  $ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_29/rc1 llvm_2.9rc1
  (This is svn rev 127232)

- Build and install LLVM:
  $ cd llvm_2.9rc1
  $ ./configure --prefix=/c/llvm --enable-optimized
  $ make
  $ make -k install   # Note: doc installation fails but we don't care

- Get the Tao source code. Put it somewhere under your home directory.
  $ cd
  $ git clone ssh://nano.taodyne.com/~ddd/Work/tao.git
  If your windows user name is not the same as your login on nano.taodyne.com,
  you may need to give your login in the URL, or connection would be rejected:
    ssh://your_login@nano.taodyne.com/~ddd/Work/tao.git
  $ cd tao
  $ git submodule init
  If you had to give login in the nano URL above, you will also need to add
  it to the submodule URLs. In this case, edit the .git/config file and fix the
  URLs before proceeding.
  $ git submodule update

- Build Tao
  $ cd ~/tao
  $ qmake -r -spec win32-g++
  $ make -j2 install  # will put the application under the "install" directory

- Optional: configure Qt Creator to build and run Tao from the Qt Creator IDE.
  This is not needed if you are OK with building from the command line.
  * Open main.pro
  * Update PATH (in Projects/Build Settings/Build Environment):
    prepend C:\llvm\bin;C:\msysgit\msysgit\bin;C:\msysgit\msysgit\mingw\lib
    With this PATH, Qt Creator will be able to find llvm-config, bash, git.
  * Change the default make specification to use:
    C:\msysgit\msysgit\mingw\bin\mingw32-make.exe
  * Set application and application current directory in
    Projects/Run Settings: the application is Tao.exe under the install
    directory. So, before you can run Tao you must execute the "install"
    target.

- Optional: install the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) from
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download.
  Not needed if you don't want to create an installer (taosetup.exe).
  Once NSIS is installed you can build the installer with:
  $ cd packaging/win
  $ make
