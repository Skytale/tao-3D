 *
 * Welcome to the online documentation for Tao Presentations.
 *
 * @section secWhatYouWillFind What is in this manual
 *
 * In this manual, you will find reference information on:
 *   - the format and structure of Tao documents,
 *   - the constructs (@a builtins) that you can use to write documents,
 *   - the XLR language, which is the basis of Tao documents.
 *
 * The reference pages also contain some examples.
 *
 * You may find more information and the latest news about Tao Presentations on
 * our web site, <a href="http://taodyne.com/">taodyne.com</a>.
 *
 * @section secGettingStarted Getting started
 *
 * The easiest way to learn Tao Presentations is probably to start with
 * sample documents and change them to your liking. This documentation is
 * there to help you understand specific aspects of the document description
 * language as you progress.
 *
 * But first, you may want to watch the following introduction video
 * (french commentary):
 *
 * @htmlonly
 * <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=LpPwjB46E5I">
 * @endhtmlonly
 * @image html youtube_tuto.png
 * @htmlonly
 * </a>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * A number of examples are available as @a templates. To create a new Tao
 * document from a template, click <tt>File > New from Template Chooser...</tt>
 * and follow the wizard. When done, click <tt>View > Document Source</tt> to
 * bring up a simple source code editor.
 * You can edit Tao Presentation documents with any text editor that supports
 * the UTF-8 encoding. Please make sure you do select this format when saving
 * your file, or non-ASCII characters may not show up correctly in Tao.
 *
 * @note Currently, only the main <tt>.ddd</tt> document file can be edited
 * with the bundled editor. Composite documents (see below) should be modified
 * with an external text editor.
 *
 * @section secTaoDocuments Tao Presentation documents
 *
 * A Tao document is a text file with the <tt>.ddd</tt> extension. The
 * character encoding is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>
 * which enables the use of international characters anywhere in the document.
 *
 * In addition to the main <tt>.ddd</tt> file, a Tao document may be composed
 * of other files:
 *  - Secondary files imported into the main file, in order to make the
 *    document more modular and easier to work with. @n
 *    These files may be <tt>.ddd</tt> files themselves, as long as they are
 *    valid Tao documents on their own. For instance, you may want to subdivide
 *    a long or complex presentation into several shorter ones, and then create
 *    a main <tt>.ddd</tt> file that will simply import all the others. @n
 *    When an imported file cannot be opened as a Tao document on its own,
 *    it is usual to name it with a <tt>.xl</tt> extension to denote that the
 *    file is XL(R) language source.
 *  - Pictures. Typically (but not necessarily) stored under the @c images
 *    subdirectory. Several file formats are supported (PNG, JPEG, and so on;
 *    refer to the @ref image primitive for details).
 *  - Fonts. TrueType or OpenType fonts may be stored in the @c fonts
 *    subdirectory.
 *
 * When it opens a document, Tao Presentation will automatically import the
 * files @c xl:user.xl and @c xl:theme.xl, in that order, if they exist
 * (see the @ref secSearchPaths "search paths" section below for details on the
 * meaning of @c xl:).
 *
 * @subsection subsecDocStructure Document structure
 *
 * Tao documents are written in the Tao language, which enables to
 * describe the structure of the document (by creating items such as:
 * pages, slides, text boxes, rectangles and so on), and at the same
 * time define its dynamic properties such as how the document changes
 * with time or external events (key press or mouse position, for
 * instance).
 *
 * You can group items and give them names using the rewrite operator @c -> and an
 * indented block, like this:
 * @code
my_items ->
    first_item
    second_item
 * @endcode
 * It means that writing @c my_items is equivalent to @c first_item followed by
 * @c second_item. You can also use parameters, such as in:
 * @code
my_circle Radius ->
    color "red"
    circle 0, 0, Radius
 * @endcode
 * Here, @c Radius may be considered as a parameter and @c my_circle is like a
 * function (or procedure).
 * @warning The unqualified word @c Radius in the left part of the @c ->
 * operator is in the same lexical scope as @c my_circle. Therefore, suppose
 * you have previously defined a @c Radius symbol, for instance
 * <tt>Radius -> 50</tt>:
 * @code
Radius -> 50
my_circle Radius ->
    color "red"
    circle 0, 0, Radius
 * @endcode
 Then, the definition of @c my_circle would evaluate
 * to:
 * @code
my_circle 50 ->
    color "red"
    circle 0, 0, 50
 * @endcode
 * ...which is legal, but probably not what you would expect: in the end,
 * only <tt>my_circle 50</tt> would be defined and could be used. Trying to
 * call @c my_circle with any other value (for instance, 100) would result
 * in an error:
@verbatim
No form matches my_circle 100
@endverbatim
 * To avoid such issues, it is recommended to use different naming
 * conventions for parameters and other symbols. In this documentation,
 * we always capitalize the parameters so they do not conflict with
 * builtins.
 * In our example, we could also qualify the @c Radius parameter to make
 * it obvious that is is a parameter:
 * @code
my_circle Radius:real ->
    color "red"
    circle 0, 0, Radius
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection secXLRef The XLR Language
 *
 * The XLR programming language is the basis of the Tao document syntax.
 * Detailed information is available in <a href="XLRef.pdf">the XLR language
 * reference guide</a>. However, a deep knowledge of XL is not needed to write
 * Tao documents.
 *
 * @subsection secBuiltins Tao Builtins and Primitives
 *
 * A @a builtin is any language construct that is not user-defined. For
 * example, @ref page is a builtin defined by the Tao program.
 *
 * Two categories of builtins can be distinguished:
 *  - @ref TaoBuiltins "Tao builtins" are implemented by the Tao Presentations
 *    program itself, and are imediately available in a document,
 *  - @ref Modules "Module builtins" are defined in @a modules, and require
 *    an @ref import statement before they can be used.
 *
 * When a builtin is implemented in native code (C or C++), it is called a
 * @a primitive.
 *
 * @subsection secVariables Variables
 *
 * To declare and initialise a variable with the current version of Tao
 * Presentations, write the following:
 @code
count -> 0  // Create variable of type integer (0 is an integer)
count := 1  // Initialize it

size -> 0.0  // Create variable of type real (0.0 is a real)
size := 10.0 // Initialize it
 @endcode
 * Make sure you do not assign an integer to a variable created as a real,
 * and vice versa. Otherwise weird things will occur, like the variable not
 * having the expected value.
 *
 * @subsection secExecModel Execution and Drawing Model
 *
 * In order to display a document, Tao @a executes the document (or parts of
 * it). The steps are the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> @b Compile and @b execute the document once. This step creates a
 *      hierarchy of objects of two kinds: @a Drawings and @a Layouts.
 *      <ul>
 *        <li> A Drawing is anything that may be drawn. For example,
 *             executing the @ref rectangle builtin creates a Drawing object
 *             of type Rectangle.
 *        <li> A Layout is a special kind of drawing that may contain other
 *             Drawings. The following builtins create Layouts: @ref page,
 *             @ref shape, @ref locally, @ref group, @ref anchor, @ref table,
 *             @ref table_cell.
 *      </ul>
 *      In addition to creating objects, the execution of some primitives
 *      makes the containing layout sensitive to some external events. @n
 *      For example, @ref seconds will request re-execution of the
 *      containing layout one second later, while @ref mouse_x will cause
 *      its re-execution upon reception of a <em>mouse move</em> event.
 * <li> @b Draw the Layout and Drawing hierarchy created by the document
 *      execution. @n
 *      For exemple, drawing a Rectangle object consists in displaying this
 *      rectangle on the screen with all the attributes that were selected
 *      during the the program execution (such as: @ref color or
 *      @ref line_color).
 * <li> @b Wait for an external event to occur.
 * <li> @b Dispatch the event from the top to the bottom of the Layout
 *      hierarchy. When a Layout is encountered that has subscribed to the
 *      event, @b re-execute the part of the document that is under that
 *      layout.
 * <li> @b Draw the complete Layout and Drawing hierarchy.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The following example shows how events trigger partial execution.
 *
 * @code
writeln "1: minutes = " & text minutes
locally
    writeln "2: seconds = " & text seconds
locally
    writeln "3: mouse_x = " & text mouse_x
 * @endcode
 *
 * The above code first writes three lines of text, one for each
 * message. This corresponds to the first, complete execution of the
 * document. @n
 * Then, line number 2 shows up every second. Indeed, the @ref seconds
 * builtin has associated a one-second timer to the Layout object created by
 * the first @ref locally block, its inner code is therefore re-executed
 * periodically.
 * Similarly, line number 3 is printed whenever the mouse is moved. Note
 * that moving the mouse does not cause line number 2 to be executed again,
 * and the second changing does not cause line number 3 to be run either. @n
 * When the minute changes, however, all three lines are displayed again.
 * This is because the @ref minutes builtin has attached a one-minute timer
 * to the main Layout object. Since the two @ref locally blocks are nested
 * inside the main Layout of the document, they get re-executed too.
 *
 * @subsection secSearchPaths Search Paths
 *
 * Some primitives that take a file name or file path accept a special syntax
 * called a <em>search path prefix</em>. For instance:
 * @code
image 0, 0, 100%, 100%, "image:file.jpg"
 * @endcode
 * The @c image: prefix indicates where to find the file. Tao will look for
 * @c file.jpg in several folders and use the first file it can find.
 * Here is where Tao will look for files for each prefix:
 * - @b image: the image folders registered by @ref Modules "modules", the
 *   @c images subfolder in the current document folder, the current document
 *   folder.
 * - @b xl: the current document folder, the user's Tao folder, the application
 *   folder.
 * - @b system: the application folder.
 *
 * The user's Tao folder is <tt>%%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Taodyne\\Tao Presentations</tt> on Windows,
 * <tt>$HOME/Library/Application Support/Tao Presentations</tt> on MacOSX,
 * and <tt>$HOME/.local/Taodyne/Tao Presentations</tt> on Linux.
 * The application folder is where Tao Presentation is installed.
 * 
 * @section secExtensions Adding Extensions
 *
 * The extensible nature of Tao Presentation helps you define and organize your
 * own re-usable pieces of documents. There are several ways of organising your
 * files.
 *
 * @subsection secImport The import statement
 *
 * The simplest way to group your own presentations in a reuseable fashion, is
 * to use the @c import keyword to refer to an external file from any Tao
 * document.
 *
 * For instance, let's assume that you are writing a presentation
 * called @c SalesReport.ddd. In this document, you want to include some
 * introductory slides, then actual sales report for two regions: the US and
 * Europe. You would like to be able to tailor your presentation to your
 * audience and show only the US report, or only the Europe part, or
 * the whole presentation.
 *
 * One way of doing this is to create three files: @c SalesReport.ddd
 * (the main document), @c US.ddd (the slides for the US region) and
 * @c Europe.ddd (for Europe), and use the @c import statement:
 * @code
// SalesReport.ddd

page "Introduction",
    // ...

import "US.ddd"
import "Europe.ddd"
 * @endcode
 * With this technique, you can open any of the three @c .ddd files
 * and thus show exactly the information you want.
 *
 * Note that imported files need not be complete, standalone presentations.
 * You may use the @c import keyword to bring in definitions or
 * utilities you want to re-use often. Consider for instance the
 * following example:
 * @code
// Example.ddd
import "my_definitions.xl"
page "Introduction",
    text_box 0, 0, window_width, window_height,
        vertical_align_center
        align_center
        my_text_color
        text "This is "
        my_highlight "highlighted"
        text " text"
 * @endcode
 * @code
// my_definitions.xl
my_text_color -> color "black"
my_highlight T:text ->
    color "red"
    text T
    my_text_color
 * @endcode
 * Just make sure that the file @c my_definitions.xl is located in the same
 * directory as the main document, @c Example.ddd (or any other file that
 * imports it). All the
 * definitions you need are in one central location, @c may_definitions.xl.
 *
 * @note It is customary to give your files a @c .xl extension when they
 * contain XL code, but are not complete Tao Presentation documents (which
 * preferably take the @c .ddd extension).
 *
 * @subsection secUserDirectory The Next Step: User Definitions
 *
 * The @c import keyword is fine to help you group custom definitions
 * in a file along with your main document. But on its own, is not very
 * convenient when you need to share definitions
 * between completely different documents. For this situation, we would like to
 * have one central location where we could store our @c .xl files, and
 * use them from any Tao document.
 *
 * Well, the @c import statement allows just that. Simply use the @c xl:
 * search path prefix. For instance, create a file called
 * @c my_definitions.xl, save it in the user-specific Tao folder
 * (see @ref secSearchPaths "above"), and use it as follows:
 * @code
import "xl:my_definitions.xl"
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection secUserModule User Modules
 *
 * Let's assume that you have written some nice XL definitions for
 * Tao Presentations, and you would like to share them with other users of
 * the program. Then you're ready to create a
 * @ref Modules "Tao Presentations module".
 *
 * There are several advantages to using a module rather than a simple
 * XL file stored in the user's Tao folder:
 *  - You can add a description, your name and your web site in a standard
 * way, so that these information appear in the module preference dialog.
 *  - A module has a version number. This makes it easier to detect
 * compatibility problems with old documents, as your module changes.
 * It also enables the automatic upgrade of your installed modules if
 * you have downloaded them from a network location (through the
 * "Check for updates" button in the module preference dialog). For more
 * information on module version numbers, see the @ref import primitive.
 *  - Modules can contain native code in the form of shared libraries,
 * which makes them a very powerful way to extend the Tao program. Native
 * modules are not covered in this documentation but in the Tao Module SDK,
 * which is available <a href="mailto:contact@taodyne.com">on request</a>.
 *
 * @subsubsection secCreatingModule Creating A Module
 *
 * To create a new module, you may use a copy of an existing module as a
 * starting point. The Tao Visuals module is a good candidate for that
 * purpose; here is how to proceed.
 *  - Locate the folder of the the Tao Visuals module: open the preference
 * dialog, click Module options, then click the info icon for to the
 * Tao Visuals entry. An information page opens. Click the link next
 * to "Installed in:" to open a file browser window in the module folder.
 *  - Copy the whole @c tao_visuals folder into the @c modules folder
 * of your user account. More specifically, you should end up with:
 *    - Windows: <tt>%%APPDATA%\\Tao Presentations\\modules\\tao_visuals</tt>.
 *      To open <tt>%%APPDATA%</tt> easily on Windows, just type <tt>%%APPDATA%</tt>
 *      in the Start menu.
 *    - MacOSX: <tt>$HOME/Library/Application Support/Tao Presentations/modules/tao_visuals</tt>.
 *     To open <tt>$HOME</tt> on MacOSX, open a new Finder window.
 *    - <tt>$HOME/.tao/modules/tao_visuals</tt> on Linux.
 *  - Rename the module. You must rename the directory
 * as well as the main XL %file: <tt>tao_visuals/tao_visuals.xl</tt> should become
 * <tt>my_module/my_module.xl</tt>.
 *  - Edit the module's contents. Change the identifier (<tt>id=</tt>). Use a
 * Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) to make sure your module won't conflict
 * with any To module. You may use the @c uuidgen command or find a website
 * that will do that for you. Change the @c name, @c description,
 * @c import_name, @c version etc. as you wish. You may also provide
 * translations. And, of course, replace all the definitions by your own.
 *  - Provide your own icon (<tt>icon.png</tt>) or just delete the icon file if
 * you don't have an icon handy.
 *  - Restart Tao Presentations and check the module info page: your module
 * should normally be in the list. If it isn't, check the troubleshooting
 * instructions below.
 *
 * @subsubsection secModuleTS Troubleshooting Modules
 *
 * You can check which modules are detected by selecting the Preferences menu
 * (Tao Presentations>Preferences on MacOSX, Help>Preferences on Windows).
 * In this dialog box you can also disable or enable modules.
 *
 * Modules from the user's home directory are loaded first, followed by
 * modules in the application directory. Therefore, if two modules with the
 * same identifier are found under both locations, the user's one is preferred
 * and the other one is ignored.
 *
 * Module debugging can be turned on as follows:
 * - Select the Debug group in the Preferences dialog, click the "modules"
 *   checkbox, click "Save". Restart Tao.
 * - Through the command line option: <tt>-tmodules</tt>
 *
 * Debug traces are sent to the standard error output (@c stderr). Their
 * final destination depends on the platform and whether you started Tao from
 * a command line prompt or using the graphical user interface, as explained
 * below.
 *
 * @section secPlatformNotes Platform Notes
 *
 * @subsection secStdoutStderr Standard Output, Standard Error
 *
 * Errors are normally shown in the application's graphical user interface,
 * either through dialog boxes or in the error display pane. However, some
 * diagnostic message are sent only to the standard output or standard error
 * channels:
 *  - Debug traces,
 *  - Messages sent by the write and writeln builtins.
 *
 * The destination of the standard output and standard error are different
 * if you are using Tao Presentations on MacOSX or on Windows.
 *
 * @subsubsection secWindows Windows
 *
 * The standard output and standard error channels of Tao Presentations are
 * normally redirected to the file @c tao.log in the @c Tao folder under the
 * current users's document folder. This file is overwritten each time the
 * application is started.
 *
 * However, if the application is started from a command prompt the standard
 * output and standard error will remain connected to the command prompt
 * window, and will not be sent to @c tao.log.
 *
 * @subsubsection secMacOSX MacOSX
 *
 * The standard output and standard error channels of Tao Presentations are
 * normally sent to log files and can be seen with the MacOSX @c console
 * application.
 *
 * However, if the application is started from a terminal, standard output
 * and standard error will remain connected to the terminal window, and
 * will not appear in the console.
