/**
 * @mainpage Tao Presentations Documentation
 *
 * Welcome to the online documentation for Tao Presentations.
 *
 * @section secShowItYourWay Show it your way
 *
 * You can build your slides to show them exactly as you want.
 * Your presentation is programmable. You code it, using predefined building
 * blocks. This allows you to build flexible taylor-made presentations.
 *
 * @section secImpressYourAudience Impress your audience
 *
 * Your slides live in a dynamic-and-3D world, just like you. Create custom
 * animations, fetch live data to feed your graphs, experience stereoscopic
 * slide shows. Your presentations will be interactive and memorable.
 *
 * @section secShareYourWork Share your work
 *
 * You keep a full history of your documents. You can create versions.
 * You can collaborate with other people on a slide deck, in real time,
 * editing the same document simultaneously. No server required.
 *
 * @section secWhatYouWillFind What is in this manual
 *
 * In this manual, you will find valuable reference information on:
 *   @li the XL language used by Tao to describe documents,
 *   @li the special XL primitives defined by the program to enable writing
 *       presentions,
 *   @li some examples.
 *
 * @section secMoreInfo More information
 *
 * Find more information and latest news about Tao Presentations on our web
 * site, http://www.taodyne.com.

 *
 * Core functions for Tao Presentations.
 *
 * Tao documents are written using the XL language. Tao builtins are XL forms
 * that you must use to describe your document. They are further divided into
 * categories as shown above.
 *
 * @todo Do we need to document the return value of the many primitives that
 *       return a boolean (often declared as "tree"), but which is rarely
 *       useful? Should we pretend they return nothing? See text and font
 *       group.
 * @todo font_scaling not documented - don't understand
 * @todo formula, text_value not documented (my tests failed on interp)
 * @todo Group Widgets not yet documented because test program does not work
 *       on interp branch
 * @todo Document movie / movie_texture?
 * @todo Document GL shader primitives?
 * @todo Document Git-related primitives (branch/commit chooser commands and
 *       checkout)?
 * @todo Document "error" primitives?
 * @todo Document "tree management" primitives? (insert, delete_selection,
 *       set_attribute)
 * @todo Document the z-order management primitives? (bring_to_front, etc.)
 * @todo Document the group management primitives? (group, group_selection,
 *       ungroup_selection)
 * @todo Document the dimension conversion postfixes? (mm, cm, inch, pt)
